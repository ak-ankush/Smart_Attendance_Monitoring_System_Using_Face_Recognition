# Smart_Attendance_Monitoring_System_Using_Face_Recognition
This repository contains the technical paper for our final-year B.Tech project titled "Smart Attendance Monitoring System Using Face Recognition", completed as part of our coursework at Reva University.

## Introduction
The project explores an automated attendance monitoring system that leverages facial recognition using two key algorithms: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and our proposed Unconstrained Face Registering Algorithm. This system addresses the inefficiencies of manual attendance in academic environments by introducing a contactless, automated solution that improves accuracy, saves time, and maintains a record of student presence through continuous observation.

## Key Features
- Face detection and recognition via webcam
- Automatic attendance marking and storage in Excel
- Real-time student login/logout tracking
- Unconstrained Face Registering Algorithm for better accuracy
- Elimination of errors due to pose variation, occlusion, and lighting

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning (PCA, K-NN)
- Windows/Linux OS
- Webcam

## My Contributions
As part of my B.Tech program, I contributed the following to this project:
- Completed the entire technical paper based on our project development and research.
- Prepared the full project report, compiling all modules, flowcharts, results, and conclusions.
- Created the presentation (PPT) used for project demonstrations and evaluations.
- Assisted the team in publication efforts, coordinating with peers and faculty to get the work published.
